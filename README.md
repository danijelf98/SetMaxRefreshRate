This script automatically detects the maximum refresh rate for each of your monitors and applies the optimal setting. This is particularly beneficial for gaming laptops, which often default to a lower refresh rate (like 60Hz) when unplugged. By using this script, you can ensure that your monitors are always operating at their highest possible refresh rate.

How To Install:
